The extension has been generated successfully.

To enable it in your application, you need to create a git repository and require it via composer.


```bash
cd /opt/lampp/htdocs/www/wuzhishan/frontend/runtime/tmp-extensions/yii2-echarts

git init
git add -A
git commit
git remote add origin https://path.to/your/repo
git push -u origin master

```


The next step is just for initial development, skip it if you directly publish the extension on packagist.org

Add the newly created repo to your *composer.json.*


```pearl
"repositories":[
    {
        "type": "git",
        "url": "https://path.to/your/repo"
    }
]
```
